# Automated-CV-Screening-Tool

## Introduction

The Automated CV Screening Tool aims to streamline and optimize the recruitment process for organizations by using advanced technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Analytics. The tool is designed to address challenges in traditional CV screening, including:

- Time-Consuming Processes: Manually reviewing hundreds or thousands of CVs is inefficient and prone to errors.
- Subjectivity and Bias: Human recruiters may unconsciously favor certain candidates, leading to biased hiring decisions.
- Inconsistency: Different recruiters may evaluate the same CV differently.
- Missed Talent: Potentially good candidates may be overlooked due to keyword mismatches or lack of time to evaluate all applications thoroughly.

This tool ensures fair, fast, and objective evaluation of candidates, enabling HR teams to focus on high-quality candidates for further rounds.
